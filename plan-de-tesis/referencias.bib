I was writing a long book, and I wanted the best. One day in January 1990, I finally got to tear open a software box bigger than some computers, and out it came.   The world's pre-eminent software manufacturer had spent roughly as long developing this word processor as the Manhattan Project had spent cooking up the atomic bomb, but secrecy had not been quite as airtight. For more than a year, Microsoft had been leaking juicy tidbits to its waiting army of trade journalists, computer consultants and corporate purchasers. Word for Windows (a.k.a. Winword or {WfW}) would be Wysiwyg (the standard acronym for What You See Is What You Get) -- that is, it would display page layouts and typefaces with high fidelity to the final printed product. It would let users work with nine documents on the screen at once. It would have a macro language -- a way to spend hours writing mini-programs to streamline all those little chores that can suck up milliseconds of a writer's time.},

	abstract = {Agile software development represents a major departure from traditional, plan-based approaches to software engineering. A systematic
review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified
1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption,
human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about
the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The
main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research
agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to
their own settings and situations.},
